# Yeep Programming Language - Status Update

## Current Status: STABLE âœ…

**Date:** June 20, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Architecture:** C++ (Migration Complete)

## What's Working

### âœ… Core Infrastructure
- **YeepEngine**: Main interpreter engine with REPL and file execution
- **Lexer**: Tokenizes source code (C++ implementation)
- **Simple Interpreter**: Handles basic print statements
- **Build System**: Official build scripts for Windows and Unix
- **Interactive REPL**: Working command-line interface

### âœ… Language Features (Current)
- **Print Statements**: `print("Hello, World!");`
- **String Literals**: Basic string support
- **File Execution**: Run `.yeep` script files
- **Interactive Mode**: REPL with help, version, exit commands
- **Error Handling**: Lexer error reporting

### âœ… Infrastructure
- **Build Scripts**: `build_official.bat` (Windows), `build_official.sh` (Unix)
- **Documentation**: README, installation guides, user guides
- **Demos**: Working demo scripts (`demo.yeep`, `demo_v2.yeep`)
- **GitHub Workflows**: CI/CD pipeline for automated builds
- **Installers**: Platform-specific installation scripts

## Architecture Status

### âœ… Completed Migration (C â†’ C++)
- **Token.hpp/cpp**: Type-safe token representation
- **Lexer.hpp/cpp**: Modern C++ lexical analyzer
- **YeepEngine.hpp/cpp**: Main interpreter engine
- **Expression.hpp/cpp**: AST foundation (partially implemented)
- **Parser.hpp/cpp**: Syntax parser (exists but not integrated)
- **Interpreter.hpp/cpp**: Full interpreter (exists but not integrated)

### ðŸ”„ Current State
- Using **simple interpretation** for reliability
- Basic print statement parsing and execution
- Stable REPL and file execution
- Clean, working codebase

## Recent Changes

### Fixed Issues
- âœ… Restored working simple interpreter logic
- âœ… Removed complex parser/interpreter integration that was causing issues
- âœ… Clean build process
- âœ… Stable print statement execution
- âœ… Working REPL

### Removed Debug Clutter
- âœ… Cleaned up debug test files
- âœ… Simplified YeepEngine to use reliable simple interpretation
- âœ… Updated version to 2.0.0

## Next Steps (Future Development)

### Phase 1: Gradual Feature Expansion
1. **Variables**: Add variable declaration and assignment
2. **Expressions**: Basic arithmetic and string operations
3. **Built-in Functions**: Math, string, utility functions
4. **Control Flow**: If statements, loops

### Phase 2: Advanced Parser Integration
1. **Full Parser**: Gradually integrate the complete parser
2. **Advanced Expressions**: Complex expressions with proper precedence
3. **Function Calls**: User-defined and built-in function calls
4. **Advanced Features**: Arrays, objects, modules

### Phase 3: Professional Release
1. **v2.1.0**: Extended language features
2. **VS Code Extension**: Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
3. **Package Managers**: Homebrew, Chocolatey, npm distribution
4. **Documentation**: Complete language specification

## Testing

### âœ… Verified Working
```bash
# Interactive REPL
./build/yeep.exe

# File execution
./build/yeep.exe demo.yeep

# Simple print statements
./build/yeep.exe test_simple.yeep
```

### Current Language Syntax
```yeep
// Basic print statements (working)
print("Hello, World!");
print("Welcome to Yeep v2.0.0!");

// Interactive commands
help      // Show help
version   // Show version info
exit      // Exit REPL
```

## Development Philosophy

**Stability First**: Maintaining a working, stable core while gradually adding features.  
**Incremental**: Build features step by step, testing thoroughly.  
**Professional**: High-quality code, documentation, and user experience.

---

**Status**: Ready for daily use with basic functionality.  
**Development**: Ongoing, focused on gradual feature expansion.  
**Quality**: Production-ready core with room for enhancement.
