# GitHub Linguist Support for Yeep Programming Language

This document outlines the steps for us to get the Yeep programming language officially recognized by GitHub Linguist, which will give it a proper icon and language statistics.

## What is GitHub Linguist?

GitHub Linguist is the library used by GitHub to detect the programming languages in repositories and provide language statistics. When a language is officially supported by Linguist, it gets:

- **Language Recognition**: `.yeep` files are properly categorized
- **Language Statistics**: Shows up in repository language bars
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Proper code highlighting (if grammar is provided)
- **Language Icon**: Custom icon in language statistics
- **File Association**: Proper file type recognition

## Steps to Add Yeep to GitHub Linguist

### 1. Create Language Definition Files

First, we need to create the proper definition files:

#### `.gitattributes` File
This tells Git how to handle `.yeep` files:

```gitattributes
*.yeep linguist-language=Yeep
```

#### Language Grammar (Optional but Recommended)
Create TextMate/VSCode grammar for syntax highlighting.

### 2. Prepare Linguist Submission

To submit Yeep to GitHub Linguist, we need:

1. **Language Definition**: YAML configuration
2. **File Samples**: Representative `.yeep` code examples  
3. **Documentation**: Language specification
4. **Community Usage**: Evidence of real-world usage

### 3. Create Language Definition YAML

For GitHub Linguist submission, we need a language definition like this:

```yaml
Yeep:
  type: programming
  color: "#00ff88"
  extensions:
  - ".yeep"
  tm_scope: source.yeep
  ace_mode: text
  language_id: 1001
  aliases:
  - yeep
```

### 4. Submit to GitHub Linguist

The process involves:

1. Fork the [GitHub Linguist repository](https://github.com/github/linguist)
2. Add Yeep language definition to `lib/linguist/languages.yml`
3. Add sample files to `samples/Yeep/`
4. Submit a Pull Request

## Requirements for Acceptance

GitHub Linguist has specific criteria for accepting new languages:

### Technical Requirements
- **Unique File Extension**: `.yeep` is unique âœ…
- **Language Specification**: Complete language documentation âœ…
- **Sample Programs**: Working code examples âœ…
- **Interpreter/Compiler**: Working implementation âœ…

### Community Requirements
- **Public Repositories**: Multiple repos using the language
- **Active Development**: Ongoing commits and releases âœ…
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides âœ…
- **Real Usage**: Evidence of practical use

### Quality Standards
- **Mature Implementation**: Stable language features
- **Proper Grammar**: Syntax highlighting support (optional)
- **Consistent Syntax**: Well-defined language rules âœ…

## Immediate Steps for Yeep

Let's prepare Yeep for Linguist submission:

### 1. Add `.gitattributes` File
Create this file in the repository root to mark `.yeep` files properly.

### 2. Create More Sample Programs
Add diverse examples showing different language features.

### 3. Encourage Community Usage
- Share Yeep on social media
- Create example projects
- Get other developers to try it

### 4. Create VSCode Extension (Optional)
A VSCode extension with syntax highlighting helps demonstrate language maturity.

## Timeline

The process typically takes:

1. **Preparation**: 1-2 weeks (creating all required files)
2. **Community Building**: 1-3 months (getting more users)
3. **Submission**: 1-2 weeks (preparing PR)
4. **Review Process**: 2-8 weeks (GitHub team review)

## Alternative: Custom Implementation

While waiting for official Linguist support, we can:

1. **Create VSCode Extension**: Provides syntax highlighting immediately
2. **Add to highlight.js**: For web syntax highlighting
3. **Submit to Code Mirror**: For online editors
4. **Create Sublime Text Package**: For Sublime Text users

## Benefits of Official Recognition

Once Yeep is in GitHub Linguist:

- **Professional Appearance**: Repositories look more professional
- **Developer Discovery**: Easier for developers to find Yeep projects
- **Language Statistics**: Accurate counting in GitHub's language stats
- **Tool Integration**: Better integration with development tools
- **Community Growth**: Increased visibility leads to more users

## Next Actions

1. âœ… Create `.gitattributes` file
2. âœ… Add more diverse code samples
3. âœ… Complete language documentation
4. ðŸ”„ Build community usage (ongoing)
5. ðŸ“‹ Prepare Linguist submission materials
6. ðŸ“‹ Submit PR to GitHub Linguist

This process will establish Yeep as a recognized programming language on GitHub!
