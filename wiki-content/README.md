   ```

2. **Copy Files**:
   ```bash
   # Copy all .md files from wiki-content/ to the wiki repository
   cp ../wiki-content/*.md ./
   ```

3. **Commit and Push**:
   ```bash
   git add *.md
   git commit -m "Add comprehensive wiki documentation"
   git push origin master
   ```

### Method 3: Bulk Upload Script

Create a script to automate the upload process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# upload-wiki.sh

# List of wiki files to upload
files=(
    "Home"
    "Installation-Guide"
    "Language-Tutorial"
    "Language-Reference"
    "Standard-Library"
    "Examples-Gallery"
    "Showcase"
    "Troubleshooting"
    "FAQ"
    "Contributing-Guide"
    "Development-Setup"
    "Architecture-Overview"
    "Release-Notes"
    "Roadmap"
    "System-Requirements"
    "Best-Practices"
)

echo "Copying wiki files..."
for file in "${files[@]}"; do
    if [ -f "wiki-content/${file}.md" ]; then
        echo "Processing ${file}.md"
        # You would need to manually upload each file to GitHub Wiki
        # This script helps organize the process
    fi
done
echo "Upload process organized. Please manually upload to GitHub Wiki."
```

## Wiki Structure

The wiki will have this structure:

```

    └── Roadmap
```

## After Upload

1. **Update README.md** - The main README now links to the wiki pages
2. **Test Links** - Make sure all wiki internal links work correctly
3. **Enable Wiki Search** - GitHub Wiki includes search functionality
4. **Monitor and Update** - Keep wiki content current with project changes

## Content Guidelines

- **Keep Updated**: Update wiki content as the project evolves
- **Cross-Reference**: Link between related wiki pages
- **Examples**: Include plenty of code examples
- **Clear Structure**: Use headers and sections for easy navigation
- **Community Input**: Encourage community contributions to the wiki
