# Icon Creation

To create an icon for the VS Code extension, you'll need a 128x128 pixel PNG image named `icon.png`.

## Temporary Icon Solution

For now, we'll use a simple text-based approach. You can create a proper icon later using:

1. **Online tools**: Like Canva, Figma, or online icon generators
2. **Design software**: Photoshop, GIMP, or other image editors
3. **Icon fonts**: Use FontAwesome or similar for a code-related icon

## Icon Requirements
- **Size**: 128x128 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- **Background**: Should work on both light and dark themes
- **Style**: Professional, recognizable, related to programming/language

## Suggested Icon Ideas
- Letter "Y" in a modern, tech-style font
- Code brackets with "Y" inside: `{Y}`
- A simple geometric shape with programming elements
- Minimalist design that represents "Yeep"

For now, let's proceed without the icon (VS Code will use a default) and you can add it later.
